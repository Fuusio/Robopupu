An Android library that provides a set of APIs for architecting and developing Android applications:

* **Robopupu.MVP**: A Model-View-Presenter (MVP) API.
* **Robopupu.Dependency**: A dependency injection/pulling API.
* **Robopupu.FSM**: A simple library for implementing hierachical Finite State Machines that support most of the UML state diagram features, including: entry points, choice points, and history points.
* **Robopupu.Plugin**: A plugin framework that supports dependency injection (DI) and allows decouples communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another.
* **Robopupu.Feature**: A flow controller type of architectural design pattern for using components that encapsulate navigation and configuration logic for application features.
* **Robopupu.Util**: A collection of utility classes.

Check out the [Robopupu project website](http://robopupu.com/) for further information.

## Robopupu Compiler
To minimize writing of boiler plate code, **Robopupu** utilises declarative annotations and annotation processing that generates code for using the libraries.
The compiler is currently included as [JAR file](https://github.com/Fuusio/Robopupu/blob/master/app/libs/robopupu-compiler.jar), but the source codes will be made soon
available as an open source project.
