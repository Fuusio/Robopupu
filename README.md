* **Robopupu.Plugin**: A plugin framework that supports dependency injection (DI) and allows decouples communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another.

## Robopupu Compiler
To minimize writing of boiler plate code, **Robopupu** utilises declarative annotations and annotation processing that generates code for using the libraries. The source codes for Robopupu Compiler and the instructions for getting started are available in Github : [https://github.com/Fuusio/Robopupu-Compiler](https://github.com/Fuusio/Robopupu-Compiler).
