# Robopupu
**Robopupu** is an Android library that provides the following APIs for developing modern Android applications:

* **Fuusio.MVP**: A Model-View-Presenter (MVP) library.
* **Fuusio.Dependency**: A dependency injection/pulling framework.
* **Fuusio.FSM**: A simple library for implementing hierachical Finite State Machines that support most of the UML state diagram features, including: entry points, choice points, and history points.
* **Fuusio.Plugin**: A plugin framework that supports dependency injection (DI) and allows decouples communication between components without requiring the components to explicitly register with one another.
* **Fuusio.Feature**: A flow controller type of architectural design pattern for using components that encapsulate navigation and configuration logic for application features.
* **Fuusio.Util**: A collection of utility classes.

## Fuusio API Compiler
To truly minimize writing of boiler plate code, **Robopupu** utilises declarative annotations and annotation processing that generates code for using the libraries.
